## 10/23/2025 - (a bit late to this) Salvaged original PCB  

I AM SO SORRY SMITH CORONA! I have salvaged the main PCB. I've taken most of the IC's out (uh, I'm guilty of maybe.... frying some... circuit bending :]) Well, I plan on replacing that all with a microcontroller. Next up is mapping the keyboard, and getting some components so that I can use the included power supply to drive both the microcontroller and the motors! Jeez, they're power hungry ones as well... don't even bring up the solenoid! I also need to source some stepper motor controllers but that's for later.
I doooo think I can use some of the things here to control the type head, the carriage stepper, etc. but that's a work in progress. ![IMG_8270.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDg2MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c193a3c6495a7e8ed740a6aa8b8778c6e6f321b5/IMG_8270.jpg)
